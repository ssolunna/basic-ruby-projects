# Basic Ruby Projects

A couple of classic “intro to programming” problems using Ruby to help solidify my knowledge and get warmed up to working on small projects.

> All the projects were assigned by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby) curriculum.

## Content

### Basic
- [**Caesar Cipher**](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-caesar-cipher): Takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string using the Caesar Cipher technique.
- [**Sub Strings**](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-sub-strings): Return a hash listing each substring from a dictionary (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

### [Recursion](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-recursion)
- **Fibonacci**: Takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence using iteration and recursion.
- **Merge Sort**: Takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology

### Data Structures and Algorithms
