# Basic Ruby Projects

A couple of classic “intro to programming” problems using Ruby to help solidify my knowledge and get warmed up to working on small projects.

> All the projects were assigned by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby) curriculum.
