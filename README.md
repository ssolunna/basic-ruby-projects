# Basic Ruby Projects

A couple of classic “intro to programming” problems using Ruby to help solidify my knowledge and get warmed up to working on small projects.

> All the projects were assigned by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby#basic-ruby-projects) curriculum.

## Content
- **Caesar Cipher**: Takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string using the Caesar Cipher technique.
- **Sub Strings**: Return a hash listing each substring from a dictionary (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
- **Stock Picker**: Takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day, and return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell.
- **Bubble sort**: Sort a group of numbers in an array using the Bubble Sort method.
